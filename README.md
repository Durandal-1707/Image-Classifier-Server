This was build as a testing out of a data science fun project I did. It's not very useful but demonstrates the capabilities of simple regression models.

It is meant to be deployed as a flask server but one can run it privately. It passes the object classify_image to a website that I set up at posthumans.tech/projects/celebrities-classifier.html
